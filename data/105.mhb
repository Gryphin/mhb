Jesus The First And The Last
Charles Wesley

Jesus, the First and Last,
On thee my soul is cast;
Thou didst thy work begin
By blotting out my sin;
Thou wilt the root remove,
And perfect me in love.

Yet when the work is done,
The work is but begun;
Partaker of thy grace,
I long to see thy face;
The first I prove below,
The last I die to know.
