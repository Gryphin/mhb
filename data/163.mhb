Dear Master In Whose Life I See
John Hunter

Dear Master, in whose life I see 
All that I would, but fail to be, 
Let thy clear light for ever shine, 
To shame and guide this life of mine. 

Though what I dream and what I do 
In my weak days and always two, 
Help me, oppressed by things undone, 
O thou, whose deeds and dreams were one!
