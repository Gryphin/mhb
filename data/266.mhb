From North And South And East And West
George Thomas Coster

From north and south 
and east and west, 
When shall the peoples, 
long unblest, 
All find their everlasting rest, 
O Christ, in Thee? 

When shall the climes 
of ageless snow 
Be with the Gospel light aglow, 
And all men their 
Redeemer know, 
O Christ, in Thee? 

When on each 
southern balmy coast, 
Shall ransomed men, 
in countless host, 
Rise, heart and voice, 
to make sweet boast, 
O Christ, in Thee? 

O when in all the Orient lands, 
From cities white, 
and flaming sands, 
Shall men lift dedicated hands, 
O Christ, in Thee? 

O when shall 
heathen darkness roll 
Away in light, from pole to pole, 
And endless day by every soul 
Be found in Thee? 

Bring, Lord, the long 
predicted hour, 
The agesâ€™ diadem and flower, 
When all shall find 
their refuge, tower, 
And home in Thee!
