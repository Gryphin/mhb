Come, Divine Interpreter
Charles Wesley

Come, divine Interpreter,
Bring me eyes Thy book to read,
Ears the mystic words to hear,
Words which did from Thee proceed,
Words that endless bliss impart,
Kept in an obedient heart.

All who read, or hear, are blessed,
If Thy plain commands we do;
Of Thy kingdom here possessed,
Thee we shall in glory view
When Thou comest on earth to abide,
Reign triumphant at Thy side.
