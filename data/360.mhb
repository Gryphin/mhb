happy the man that finds the grace
Charles Wesley

Join, all ye ransomed sons of grace,
The holy joy prolong,
And shout to the Redeemers praise
A solemn midnight song.

Blessing, and thanks, and love, and might,
Be to our Jesus givn,
Who turns our darkness into light
Who turns our hell to Heavn.

Thither our faithful souls He leads,
Thither He bids us rise,
With crowns of joy upon our heads,
To meet Him in the skies.
