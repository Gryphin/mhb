Hail! Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord!
Charles Wesley

Hail! Holy, holy, holy Lord! 
Whom One in Thee we know; 
By all Thy heavenly host adored, 
By all Thy church below. 

One undivided Trinity 
With triumph we proclaim; 
Thy universe is full of Thee, 
And speaks Thy glorious name. 

Thee, holy Father, we confess, 
Thee, holy Son, adore, 
Thee, Spirâ€™t of truth and holiness, 
We worship evermore. 

The incommunicable right,
Almighty God! receive,
Which angel-choirs, and saints in light,
And saints embodied give.

Three Persons equally divine 
We magnify and love; 
And both the choirs ere long shall join 
To sing Thy praise above. 

Hail! Holy, holy, holy Lord, 
Our heavenly song shall be, 
Supreme, essential One, adored 
In co-eternal Three.
