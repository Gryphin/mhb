The God Of Love To Earth He Came
Charles Wesley

The God of love,
to earth He came,
That you might come to heaven;
Believe, believe in Jesu’s name,
And all your sin’s forgiven.

Believe in Him 
that died for thee,
And, sure as He hath died,
Thy debt is paid,
thy soul is free,
And thou art justified.
