My Soul Through My Redeemer's Care
Charles Wesley

My soul, through my Redeemer's care,
Saved from the second death I feel,
My eyes from tears of dark despair,
My feet from falling into hell.

Wherefore to him my feet shall run,
My eyes on his perfections gaze,
My soul shall live for God alone,
And all within me shout his praise.
