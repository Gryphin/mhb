O Savior, I Have Naught To Plead
Jane Crewdson

O Savior, I have naught to plead,
In earth beneath or Heaven above,
But just in my own exceeding need,
And Thy exceeding love.

The need will soon be past and gone,
Exceeding great, but quickly oer;
The love unbought is all Thine own,
And lasts forevermore.
