Captain of Israel's Host
Charles Wes­ley

Captain of Israel’s host, and Guide
Of all who seek the land above,
Beneath Thy shadow we abide,
The cloud of Thy protecting love;
Our strength, Thy grace; our rule, Thy Word;
Our end, the glory of the Lord.

By Thine unerring Spirit led,
We shall not in the desert stray;
The light of man’s direction need
Or miss our providential way;
As far from danger as from fear,
While Love, almighty Love, is near.
