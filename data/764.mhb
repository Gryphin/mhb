Author Of Life Divine
John Wesley

Author of life divine,

Who hast a table spread,

Furnished with mystic wine

And everlasting bread,

Preserve the life Thyself hast given,

And feed and train us up for Heavn.
Our needy souls sustain

With fresh supplies of love,

Till all Thy life we gain,

And all Thy fullness prove,

And, strengthened by Thy perfect grace,

Behold without a veil Thy face.
