Come, Holy Ghost, Thine Influence Shed
Charles Wesley

Come, Holy Ghost, thine influence shed,
And realize the sign;
Thy life infuse into the bread,
Thy power into the wine.

Effectual let the tokens prove
And made, by heavenly art,
Fit channels to convey thy love
To every faithful heart.
