Bread Of Heaven, On Thee I Feed
Josiah Conder

Bread of heaven! on thee I feed,
For thy flesh is meat indeed.
Ever may my soul be fed
With this true and living bread:
Day by day with strength supplied
Through the life of him who died.

Vine Of heaven! thy blood supplies
This blest cup of sacrifice;
'Tis thy wounds my healing give;
To thy cross I look and live.
Thou my life! O let me be
Rooted, grafted, built on thee!
