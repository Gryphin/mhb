O God To Whom The Faithful Dead
Josiah Conder

O God, to whom the faithful dead
Still live, united to their Head,
Their Lord and ours the same:
For all thy saints, to memory dear,
Departed in thy faith and fear,
We bless thy holy name.

By the same grace upheld, may we
So follow those who followed thee,
As with them to partake
The full reward of heavenly bliss:
Merciful Father! grant us this
For our Redeemer's sake.
