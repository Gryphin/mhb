God Bless Our Native Land
Charles Brooks

God bless our native land!
Firm may she ever stand
Through storm and night!
When the wild tempests rave,
Ruler of wind and wave,
Father Eternal, save
Us by Thy might!

Lo! our hearts prayers arise
Into the upper skies,
Regions of light!
He Who hath heard each sigh,
Watches each weeping eye:
He is forever nigh,
Venger of Right.
