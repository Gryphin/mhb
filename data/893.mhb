O Ye Who Taste That Love Is Sweet
Christina Georgina Rossetti

O ye who taste that love is sweet,
Set waymarks for all doubtful feet
That stumble on in search of it.

Sing notes of love: that some who hear
Far off, inert, may lend an ear,
Rise up and wonder and draw near.

Lead lives of love: that others who
Behold your life may kindle too
With love, and cast their lot with you.
