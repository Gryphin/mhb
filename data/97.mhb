O Filial Deity Accept My Newborn Cry
Charles Wesley

O filial Deity,
Accept my new-born cry!
See the travail of thy soul,
Saviour, and be satisfied;
Take me now, possess me whole,
Who for me, for me, hast died!

Of life thou art the tree,
My immortality!
Feed this tender branch of thine,
Ceaseless influence derive;
Thou the true, the heavenly Vine;
Grafted into thee I live.
