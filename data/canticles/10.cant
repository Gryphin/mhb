Nunc Dimittis



1 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word.

2 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

3 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

4 To be a light to lighten the Gentiles and to be the glory of thy people Israel.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.
