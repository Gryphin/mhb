I Know That My Redeemer Lives
Asa Brooks Everett

I know that my Redeemer lives, 
And ever prays for me; 
A token of His love He gives, 
A pledge of liberty. 

I find him lifting up my head, 
He brings salvation near, 
His presence makes me free indeed, 
And He will soon appear. 

He wills that I should holy be, 
What can withstand His will? 
The counsel of His grace in me 
He surely shall fulfill. 

Jesus, I hang upon Thy Word; 
I steadfastly believe 
Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord 
And to Thyself receive, 

Joyful in hope, my spirit soars 
To meet Thee from above, 
Thy goodness thankfully adores; 
And sure I taste Thy love. 

Thy love I soon expect to find, 
In all its depth and height; 
To comprehend the eternal mind, 
And grasp the Infinite. 

When God is Mine and I am His, 
Of paradise possessed, 
I taste unutterable bliss, 
And everlasting rest. 

The bliss of those that fully dwell, 
Fully in Thee believe, 
â€™Tis more than angel tongues can tell, 
Or angel minds conceive. 

Thou only knowst, Who didst obtain, 
And die to make it known; 
The great salvation now explain, 
And perfect us in one!
