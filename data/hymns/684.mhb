Jesus Stand Among Us In Thy Risen Power
William Pennefather

Jesus, stand among us 
In Thy risen power; 
Let this time of worship 
Be a hallowed hour. 

Breathe the Holy Spirit 
Into every Heart; 
Bid the fears and sorrows 
From each soul depart. 

Thus with quickened footsteps, 
We'll pursue our way, 
Watching for the dawning 
Of eternal day.
