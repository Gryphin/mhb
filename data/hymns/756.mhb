Bread Of The World, In Mercy Broken
Reginald Heber

Bread of the world, in mercy broken,

Wine of the soul, in mercy shed,

By Whom the words of life were spoken,

And in Whose death our sins are dead.
Look on the heart by sorrow broken,

Look on the tears by sinners shed;

And be Thy feast to us the token,

That by Thy grace our souls are fed.
