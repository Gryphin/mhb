In Memory Of The Saviour's Love
Thomas Cotterill

In memory of the Savior’s love 
We keep the sacred feast, 
When every humble, contrite heart 
Is made a welcome guest. 


Symbolic of His broken flesh, 
We take the broken bread, 
The cup in token of His blood 
That was for sinners shed. 


Under His banner now we sing 
The wonders of His love 
And so anticipate by faith 
The heav’nly feast above.
