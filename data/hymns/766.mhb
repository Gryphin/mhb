Be Known To Us In Breaking Breaed
James Montgomery

Be known to us in breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Savior, abide with us, and spread
Thy table in our heart

There eat with us in love divine;
Thy body and Thy blood,
That living bread, that heavenly wine,
Be our immortal food
