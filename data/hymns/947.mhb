Ere I Sleep, For Ever Favour
John Cennick

Ere I sleep, for every favor,
This day showed, by my God,
I will bless my Savior.

O my Lord, what shall I render
To Thy Name, still the same,
Gracious, good, and tender?

Leave me not, but ever love me;
Let Thy peace, be my bliss,
Till Thou hence remove me.
