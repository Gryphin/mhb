311 thy faithfulness, lord, each moment we find
811 thy kingdom come, o god
742 thy kingdom come- on bended knee
391 thy life was given for me 
515 thy way, not mine o lord
15  tired with the greatness of my way
40  'tis done! thou dost this moment save
537 'tis not to ask for gifts alone
313 to god be the glory
638 to god, the only wise
459 to the haven of thy breast
497 to the hills i lift mine eyes
93  to the name of our salvation
964 to thee, o lord, our hearts we raise
886 to thee our god we fly
141 to us a child of royal birth
44  touched by the loadstone of thy love
912 turn back, o man, forswear thy foolish ways
771 victim divine, thy grace we claim

872 we bless thee, lord, ofr all this common life
71  we come unto our fathers' god
40  we give immortal praise
923 we give thee but thine own

741 we have not known thee as we ought
88  we know, by faith we surely know
677 we love the place, o god
708 we love thy kingdom, lord
963 we plough the fields, and scatter
666 we rose to-day with anthems sweet
148 we saw thee not when thou didst come
196 we sing the praise of him who died
414 we thank thee, lord, for this fair earth
355 weary of earth and laden with my sin
319 weary souls that wander wide
175 weep not for him who onward bears
212 ewlcome, happy morning! age to age shall say
538 what a friend we have in jesus
833 what are these arrayed in white
145 what grace, o lord, and beauty shone
557 what is our calling's glorious hope
152 what means this eager, anxious throng
897 what service shall we render thee
77  what shall i do my god to love, my loving
452 what shall i do my god to love, my saviour
28  what shall i do to keep
399 what shall i render to my god
784 what shall we offer our good lord
413 when all thy mercies, o my god
37  when god is mine, and i am his
276 when god of old came from heaven 
835 when, his salvation bringing
182 when i surver the wondrous cross
32  when jesus makes my heart his home
113 when morning gilds the skies
866 when mothers of salem
178 when my love to christ grows weak
555 when, my saviour, shall i be
642 when on my day of life the night is falling
978 when our heads are bowed with woe
310 when quiet in my house i sit
341 when shall thy love constrain
975 when the day of toil is done
147 when the lord of love was here
735 when the wearty, seeking rest
643 when this passing world is done
398 when thy soldiers take their swords
516 when when we walk with the lord
909 when wilt thou save the people
895 where cross the crowded ways of life
361 where  shall my wondering soul begin
343 wherewith, o god, shall i draw near
641 while ebbing nature grieves
129 while shepherds watched their flocks by night
513 who fathoms the eternal thought
700 who in the lord confide
151 who is he, in yonder stall
820 who is on the lord's side
50  who who on earth can conceive
495 who puts his trus
620 who would true valour see
317 whosoever heareth! shout, shout the sound
634 will your anchor hold in the storms of life
862 wise men, seeking jesus
350 with broken heart and contrite sigh
11  with gladness we worship, rejoice as we sing
172 with glorious clouds encompassed round
236 with joy we meditate the grace
913 with the sweet word of peace
489 workman of god! o lose not heart
412 worship, and thanks, and blessing
173 would jesus have the sinner die
229 ye faithful souls who jesus know
26  ye holy angels bright
217 ye humble souls that seek the lord
12  ye mountains and vales, in praises abound
329 ye neightbours and friends of jesus draw near
426 ye servants of god
581 ye servants of the lord
628 ye that do your master's will
968 yes, god is good - in earth and sky
339 yield to me now; for i am weak. part 2
