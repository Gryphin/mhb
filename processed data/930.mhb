O Lord Of Life, Thy Quickening Voice
George MacDonald

O Lord of life, Thy quickening voice,
Awakes my morning song!
In gladsome words I would rejoice
That I to Thee belong.

I see Thy light, I feel thy wind;
The world it is Thy Word;
Whatever wakes my heart and mind
Thy presence is, my Lord.

Therefore I choose my highest part,
And turn my face to Thee;
Therefore I stir my inmost heart
To worship fervently.
