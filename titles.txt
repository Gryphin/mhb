If I Should Be Living When Jesus Comes
If I Walk in the Pathway of Duty
If in the Valley Where the Bright Waters Flow
If Jesus Goes with Me
If Jesus Leads This Army
If, On a Quiet Sea
If Our Lord Should Come Tonight
If Pathless Forests Meet My View
If Singing His Praises Is Sweet to Us Here
If the Dark Shadows Gather as You Go Along
If the World from You Withhold
If There Be That Skills to Reckon
If There Is Abundance of Joy in Your Heart
If Thou but Suffer God to Guide Thee
If Thou Shalt Confess
If Thy Belovd Son, O God
If to Christ Our Only King
If Tonight Should End the World
If We Brightly Shine
If We Have Forgotten the Name of Our God
If You Are Tired of the Load of Your Sin
If You Cannot On the Ocean
If You Could See Christ Standing Here Tonight
If You Will Only Let God Guide You
If You Would Come After Me
If You Would Find the Better Land
If Your Heart Keeps Right
If Your Own Sorrows You Want to Forget
Ill Be a Sunbeam
Ill Be a Voice
Ill Bear It, Lord, for Thee
Ill Bless the Lord from Day to Day
Ill Count My Blessings
Ill Fly Away
Ill Go Where You Want Me to Go
Ill Live for Him
Ill Live On
Ill Not Give Up the Bible
Ill Overcome Some Day
Ill Praise My Maker
Ill See the New Jerusalem
Ill Speak the Honors of My King
Ill Stand by Until the Morning

Why Did the Gentiles Tumults Raise?
Why Did the Jews Proclaim Their Rage?
Why Did the Nations Join to Slay
Why Do the Holy Angels Sing?
Why Do the Wealthy Wicked Boast?
Why Do We Mourn Departing Friends?
Why Do You Wait?
Why Does Your Face, Ye Humble Souls
Why Dost Thou Stand Afar
Why Doth the Lord Stand off so Far?
Why Doth the Man of Riches Grow?
Why Has My God My Soul Forsook?
Why, Herod, Unrelenting Foe
Why, Impious Herod, Shouldst Thou Fear
Why Not Now?
Why Not Say Yes Tonight?
Why Should Cross and Trial Grieve Me?
Why Should I Charge My Soul with Care?
Why Should I Fear in Evil Days
Why Should I Feel Discouraged
Why Should I Vex My Soul?
Why Should Our Tears in Sorrow Flow
Why Should the Children of a King
Why Should We Start, and Fear to Die?
Why Stand Ye Idly Gazing
Why Standest Thou Afar, O Lord?
Why Will Ye Wander?
Why Will Ye Waste On Trifling Cares
Wide Open Are Thy Hands
Wide the Gates of Morning Open
Wide, Wide as the Ocean
Will Jesus Find Us Watching?
Will the Angels Come?
Will the Circle Be Unbroken?
Will There Be Any Stars?
Will You Come? (Crosby)
Will You Come? (Reynolds)
Will You Go?
Will You Go and Speak to the Lost Ones Here
Will You Go to Jesus Now, Dear Friend
Will You Meet Me in the Homeland
Will You Take Jesus to Be Your Guide?
Will You Take Jesus Today?
Will Your Anchor Hold
Wilt Thou Be Made Whole?
Wilt Thou Forgive?
Wilt Thou Hear the Voice of Praise?
