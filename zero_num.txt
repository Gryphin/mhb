565 I know that my redeemer lives, and ever
366 Jesus! Redeemer, savior lord
908 Life of ages, richly poured
265 Lift up your heads, ye gates of brass
890 Lift up your heads, ye might gates
722 Lift up your hearts to things above
686 Lift up your hearts! We lift
663 Light of light, enlighten me
268 Light of the lonely pilgrimâ€™s heart
636 Light of the world, faint were our weary feet
531 Light of the world, thy beams I bless
488 oft in danger, oft in woe
502 omnipotent lord, my saviour and king
800 saviour, quicken many nations
269 saviour, we know thou art
726 saviour, when in dust to thee
98  thou hidden source of calm repose
